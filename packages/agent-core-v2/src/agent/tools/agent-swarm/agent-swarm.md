Launch multiple subagents from one prompt template, existing agent resumes, or both.

Use AgentSwarm when many subagents should run the same kind of task over different inputs. The placeholder is exactly `{{item}}`. For example, with `prompt_template` set to `Review {{item}} for likely regressions.` and `items` set to `["src/a.ts", "src/b.ts"]`, AgentSwarm launches two new subagents with those two concrete prompts. For a few differently-shaped tasks, make separate `Agent` calls in one message instead.

Use `resume_agent_ids` when new work clearly continues an existing subagent's earlier assignment, including a completed assignment in the same module, path, work item, or line of investigation. The resumed subagent keeps its prior context. When TeamStatus is available, inspect its `reusableMembers` before a follow-up batch. Resume only members whose prior assignment is genuinely relevant; launch a new item-based subagent when the relationship is unclear. You may combine `resume_agent_ids` with `items` in the same call, but do not duplicate resumed work in `items`.

Each of these is enforced — a violation is rejected before any subagent starts: provide at least 2 `items` unless you pass `resume_agent_ids`; whenever `items` are present, `prompt_template` is required and must contain `{{item}}`; and the filled-in prompts must be distinct (two items that expand to the same prompt are rejected).

Use enough subagents to keep the work focused and parallel. AgentSwarm supports up to 128 subagents, and launches are queued automatically, so it is safe to split large tasks into many clear, independent items.

If `AgentSwarm` is called, that call must be the only tool call in the response.
